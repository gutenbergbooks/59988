<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="nind"><i><span class="smcap">The</span> fifty poems here brought together under the title ‘Poems of Nature’
are perhaps two-thirds of those which Thoreau preserved. Many of them
were printed by him, in whole or in part, among his early contributions
to Emerson’s</i> Dial, <i>or in his own two volumes</i>, The Week <i>and</i> Walden,
<i>which were all that were issued in his lifetime. Others were given to
Mr. Sanborn for publication, by Sophia Thoreau, the year after her
brother’s death (several appeared in the</i> Boston Commonwealth <i>in 1863);
or have been furnished from time to time by Mr. Blake, his literary
executor.</i></p>

<p><i>Most of Thoreau’s poems were composed early in his life, before his
twenty-sixth year, ‘Just now’ he wrote in the autumn of 1841, ‘I am in
the mid-sea of verses, and they actually rustle round me, as the leaves
would round the head of Autumnus himself, should he thrust it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> up
through some vales which I know; but, alas! many of them are but crisped
and yellow leaves like his, I fear, and will deserve no better fate than
to make mould for new harvests.’ After 1843 he seems to have written but
few poems, and had destroyed perhaps as many as he had retained, because
they did not meet the exacting requirements of his friend Emerson, upon
whose opinion at that time he placed great reliance. This loss was
regretted by Thoreau in after years, when the poetical habit had left
him, for he fancied that some of the verses were better than his friend
had supposed. But Emerson, who seldom changed his mind, adhered to his
verdict, and while praising some of the poems highly, perhaps
extravagantly, would admit but a small number of them to the slight
selection which he appended to the posthumous edition of Thoreau’s</i>
Letters, <i>edited by him in 1865; and even these were printed, in some
instances, in an abbreviated and imperfect form.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>A few other
poems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> with some translations from the Greek, have lately been included
by Thoreau’s Boston publishers in their volume of</i> Miscellanies (<i>vol.</i>
x. <i>of the Riverside Edition, 1894</i>). <i>But no collection so full as the
present one has ever been offered to the public.</i></p>

<p><i>It has not been attempted to make this a complete collection of
Thoreau’s poems, because, as has been well said, ‘many of them seem to
be merely pendants to his prose discourse, dropped in as forcible
epigrams where they are brief, and in other instances made ancillary to
the idea just expressed, or to perpetuate a distinct conception that has
some vital connection with the point from which it was poured forth. It
is, therefore, almost an injustice to treat them separately at all.’</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<i>After the discontinuance of</i> The Dial, <i>Thoreau ceased to publish his
verses as separate poems, but interpolated them, in the manner
described, in his prose essays, where they form a sort of accompaniment
to the thought, and from which it is in many cases impossible to detach
them. That he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span> himself set some value on them in this connection may be
gathered from a sentence in the last of his published letters, in which
he writes to a correspondent: ‘I am pleased when you say that in</i> The
Week <i>you like especially those little snatches of poetry interspersed
through the book, for these I suppose are the least attractive to most
readers.’</i></p>

<p><i>Everything that concerns a great writer has its special interest; and
Thoreau’s poetry, whatever its intrinsic value may be, is full of
personal significance; in fact, as Emerson remarked, ‘his biography is
in his verses.’ Thus, many of these poems will be found to throw light
on certain passages of his life. ‘Inspiration,’ for example, is the
record of his soul’s awakening to the new impulse of transcendentalism;
the stanzas on ‘Sympathy’ perhaps contain in a thinly disguised form the
story of his youthful love, and the sacrifice which he imposed on
himself to avoid rivalry with his brother; the lines ‘To my Brother’
refer to the sudden and tragic death of John Thoreau in 1842; and ‘The
Departure’ is believed to be the poem in which Henry Thoreau, when
leaving in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span> 1843 the home of Emerson, where he had lived for two years,
took farewell of his friends. The numerous other allusions to the life
and scenery of Concord, with which Thoreau’s own life was so closely
blended, require no comment or explanation.</i></p>

<p><i>Thoreau’s view of the poetic character, as stated by him in</i> The Week,
<i>is illustrative of his own position. ‘A true poem,’ he says, ‘is
distinguished not so much by a felicitous expression, or any thought it
suggests, as by the atmosphere which surrounds it. There are two classes
of men called poets. The one cultivates life, the other art: one seeks
food for nutriment, the other for flavor; one satisfies hunger, the
other gratifies the palate.’ There can be no doubt to which of these
classes Thoreau himself belongs. If metrical skill be insisted on as an
indispensable condition of poetry, he can hardly be ranked among the
poets; nor, where this criterion was dominant, was it surprising that,
as one of his contemporaries tells us,</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>with reference to his verses
in</i> The Dial, <i>‘an unquenchable laughter, like that of the gods at
Vulca<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span>n’s limping, went up over his ragged and halting lines.’ But in
the appreciation of poetry there is a good deal more to be considered
than this; and, as the same writer has remarked, there is ‘a frank and
unpretending nobleness’ in many of Thoreau’s verses, distinguished as
they are, at their best, by their ripe fulness of thought, quiet gravity
of tone, and epigrammatic terseness of expression. The title of poet
could hardly be withheld from the author of such truly powerful pieces
as ‘The Fall of the Leaf,’ ‘Winter Memories,’ ‘Smoke in Winter,’ or
‘Inspiration.’</i></p>

<p><i>Nor should it be forgotten that Thoreau was always regarded as a poet
by those who were associated with him. ‘Poet-Naturalist’ was the
suggestive title which Ellery Channing applied to him; and Hawthorne
remarked that ‘his thoughts seem to measure and attune themselves into
spontaneous verse, as they rightfully may, since there is real poetry in
them.’ Even Emerson’s final estimate was far from unappreciative. ‘His
poetry,’ he wrote in his biographical sketch, ‘might be bad or good; he
no doubt wanted a lyric facility and technical skill, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span> had the
source of poetry in his spiritual perception. His own verses are often
rude and defective. The gold does not yet run pure&mdash;is drossy and crude.
The thyme and marjoram are not yet honey. But if he want lyric fineness
and technical merits, if he have not the poetic temperament, he never
lacks the causal thought, showing that his genius was better than his
talent.’</i></p>

<p><i>Perhaps what Thoreau said of Quarles, one of that school of gnomic
poets of which he was a student, might be aptly applied to himself: ‘It
is rare to find one who was so much of a poet and so little of an
artist. Hopelessly quaint, he never doubts his genius; it is only he and
his God in all the world. He uses language sometimes as greatly as
Shakespeare; and though there is not much straight grain in him, there
is plenty of rough, crooked timber.’ The affinity of Thoreau’s style to
that of Herbert, Donne, Cowley, and other minor Elizabethans, has often
been remarked; and it has been truly said that the stanzas ‘Sic Vita’
might almost have a niche in Herbert’s</i> Temple.</p>

<p><i>It must be granted, then, that Thoreau, whatever his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span> limitations, had
the poet’s vision, and sometimes the poet’s divine faculty; and if this
was manifested more frequently in his masterly prose, it was neither
absent from his verse nor from the whole tenor of his character. It was
his destiny to be one of the greatest prose writers whom America has
produced, and he had a strong, perhaps an exaggerated, sense of the
dignity of this calling. ‘Great prose,’ he thinks, ‘of equal elevation,
commands our respect more than great verse, since it implies a more
permanent and level height, a life more pervaded with the grandeur of
the thought. The poet only makes an irruption, like a Parthian, and is
off again, shooting while he retreats; but the prose writer has
conquered, like a Roman, and settled colonies.’</i></p>

<p><i>If, therefore, we cannot unreservedly place Thoreau among the poetical
brotherhood, we may at least recognise that he was a poet in the larger
sense in which his friends so regarded him&mdash;he felt, thought, acted, and
lived as a poet, though he did not always write as one. In his own
words</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This poem was written on a sheet of paper wrapped round a
bunch of violets, tied loosely with a straw, and thrown into the window
of a friend. It was read at Thoreau’s funeral by his friend Bronson
Alcott.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The above title, prefixed to these stanzas in Emerson’s
selection, is scarcely suited to so personal and characteristic a poem.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Suggested by the print of Guido’s ‘Aurora,’ sent by Mrs.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The explanation of this poem, given on Emerson’s authority,
but necessarily somewhat conjectural, is that a reference is made, under
the character of the ‘gentle boy,’ to the girl with whom both Henry and
John Thoreau were in love.</p></div>

published in the <i>Boston Commonwealth</i> in 1863, under the title of ‘The
Soul’s Season,’ the remainder as ‘The Fall of the Leaf.’ There can be
little doubt that they are parts of one complete poem.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> These stanzas formed part of the original manuscript of
